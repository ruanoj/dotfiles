##dotfiles
My very own stolen and personalised dotfile repository.

##Quickstart
- `make` will create symlinks and clone [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

##Vim plugins
- Run `:BundleInstall` from Vim to install plugins configured in `vim/vimrc`.

##Requirements
- git
- make

##Notes
- Tested on Mac OS X, but it should work on other platforms
- Where possible, references to user folders have been replaced with $HOME or ~
